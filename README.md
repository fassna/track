### Project Description
EcoTrack is a smart waste reporting and reuse awareness platform that promotes sustainable waste management through community participation and reward-based engagement.

### The Problem statement
Improper waste disposal, lack of recycling awareness, and absence of an easy reporting mechanism contribute to environmental pollution and health hazards.  

Many citizens are unaware of:
- Where to report unmanaged waste  
- How to recycle different types of waste  
- How to reuse everyday materials instead of discarding them  

This leads to increased landfill waste, environmental degradation, and loss of reusable resources.


### The Solution
# ♻️ EcoTrack

EcoTrack is a smart waste reporting and reuse awareness platform developed to promote sustainable waste management and circular economy practices.

## 🟢 Problem Statement

Improper waste disposal, lack of recycling awareness, and absence of an easy reporting mechanism contribute to environmental pollution and health hazards.  

Many citizens are unaware of:
- Where to report unmanaged waste  
- How to recycle different types of waste  
- How to reuse everyday materials instead of discarding them  

This leads to increased landfill waste, environmental degradation, and loss of reusable resources.

## 🟢 Proposed Solution

EcoTrack provides a digital platform that enables users to:

- 📸 Report improperly disposed waste with image and location  
- 📍 Locate nearby recycling centers based on waste category  
- ♻️ Explore creative reuse and DIY ideas for common materials  
- 🏆 Earn reward points for eco-friendly participation  

The system also includes an **Authority Dashboard** where officials can review complaints and mark them as resolved.

EcoTrack promotes responsible waste management through community participation and gamification.
